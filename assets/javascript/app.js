// start with multiple variables to hold the questions and answers for the trivia game (most likely arrays within a master array)
// create a variable to hold the users choice for the question
// add more variables, to count correct and incorrect guesses, and a last variable to show the users score (out of 100)

// create logic to get questions at random and their answers and display them using the HTML
    // example = var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1; <=== something like that

// create a timer, display it to the user, and if the timer reaches 0 before the user is done, stop the quiz and count all questions not answered as wrong
    // ex: setTimeout(timeUp, 15000);

// use buttons in html for the multiple choice questions and log the users response
    // ex: newDiv.button("option A"); etc

// create logic to determind if the users choices are right or wrong
    // if (userAnswer === correctAnswer) {....} else {......}
// take the questions that the user got correct and turn it into a score out of 100 possible points.
    // questionsRight.value * x (and put it over 100)
// create a button to reset the game without having to refresh the page.
